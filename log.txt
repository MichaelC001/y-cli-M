Okay, I can explain that without searching.

In Python, a **class** is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object is a specific instance of a class; it has its own unique data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined by the class.

Think of it this way:
*   **Class:** The general concept of a "Car." It defines what a car is: it has wheels, an engine, a color (attributes), and it can start, stop, accelerate (methods).
*   **Object:** Your specific red Toyota Camry, or my blue Honda Civic. These are individual *instances* of the "Car" class. They share the common properties and behaviors defined by the "Car" class but have their own specific values for those properties (e.g., your car is red, mine is blue).

Classes help in organizing code, making it reusable, and modeling real-world (or abstract) entities. This is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Here are two examples:

**Example 1: A simple `Dog` class**

```python
class Dog:
    # This is the constructor method, called when you create a new Dog object
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name  # Attribute: name of the dog
        self.breed = breed # Attribute: breed of the dog
        self.is_sitting = False # Attribute: current state

    # This is a method (an action the dog can perform)
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    def sit(self):
        self.is_sitting = True
        return f"{self.name} is now sitting."

    def stand(self):
        self.is_sitting = False
        return f"{self.name} is now standing."

# Creating objects (instances) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
your_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(f"{my_dog.name} is a {my_dog.breed}.") # Output: Buddy is a Golden Retriever.
print(my_dog.bark())                         # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(your_dog.sit())                        # Output: Lucy is now sitting.
print(f"Is Lucy sitting? {your_dog.is_sitting}") # Output: Is Lucy sitting? True
```

**Explanation of Example 1:**
*   `class Dog:` defines the blueprint.
*   `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It initializes a new `Dog` object with a `name` and `breed`. `self` refers to the instance being created.
*   `name` and `breed` are attributes (data) of each dog object.
*   `bark`, `sit`, and `stand` are methods (actions) that any `Dog` object can perform.
*   `my_dog` and `your_dog` are two distinct objects (instances) of the `Dog` class.

**Example 2: A `Rectangle` class**

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width   # Attribute
        self.height = height # Attribute

    def area(self):
        # Method to calculate area
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        # Method to calculate perimeter
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

# Creating Rectangle objects
rect1 = Rectangle(5, 10)
rect2 = Rectangle(3, 7)

# Using the methods
print(f"Rectangle 1 Area: {rect1.area()}")         # Output: Rectangle 1 Area: 50
print(f"Rectangle 1 Perimeter: {rect1.perimeter()}") # Output: Rectangle 1 Perimeter: 30

print(f"Rectangle 2 Area: {rect2.area()}")         # Output: Rectangle 2 Area: 21
print(f"Rectangle 2 Perimeter: {rect2.perimeter()}") # Output: Rectangle 2 Perimeter: 20
```

**Explanation of Example 2:**
*   The `Rectangle` class has attributes `width` and `height`.
*   It has methods `area()` and `perimeter()` to perform calculations based on its attributes.
*   `rect1` and `rect2` are two different rectangle objects, each with its own dimensions and calculable area/perimeter.

In essence, classes allow you to define custom data types that bundle data (attributes) and functionality (methods) together.
