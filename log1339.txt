Okay, I can explain that without searching.

In Python, a **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and the cookies you make with it are the objects (instances). The cutter defines the shape and features (attributes) of the cookie, and what you can do with the cookie (methods).

Here are two examples:

**Example 1: A simple `Dog` class**

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    # Initializer / Instance attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute
        self.breed = breed  # Instance attribute

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    # Another instance method
    def describe(self):
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}."

# Creating objects (instances) of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3, "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Lucy", 5, "Poodle")

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(dog1.name)         # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.breed)        # Output: Poodle
print(dog1.bark())       # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(dog2.describe())   # Output: Lucy is a 5-year-old Poodle.
print(Dog.species)       # Output: Canis familiaris (accessing class attribute)
```

**Explanation:**
*   `class Dog:` defines a new class named `Dog`.
*   `species = "Canis familiaris"` is a class attribute. It's shared by all `Dog` objects.
*   `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It's automatically called when you create a new object of the class. `self` refers to the instance being created.
*   `self.name`, `self.age`, `self.breed` are instance attributes. They are specific to each `Dog` object.
*   `bark(self)` and `describe(self)` are instance methods. They can access and modify instance attributes.

**Example 2: A `Rectangle` class**

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    # Method to calculate area
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    # Method to calculate perimeter
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

    # Method to check if it's a square
    def is_square(self):
        return self.width == self.height

# Creating objects (instances) of the Rectangle class
rect1 = Rectangle(5, 10)
rect2 = Rectangle(7, 7) # This will be a square

# Using the methods
print(f"Rectangle 1 Area: {rect1.area()}")          # Output: Rectangle 1 Area: 50
print(f"Rectangle 1 Perimeter: {rect1.perimeter()}") # Output: Rectangle 1 Perimeter: 30
print(f"Is Rectangle 1 a square? {rect1.is_square()}") # Output: Is Rectangle 1 a square? False

print(f"Rectangle 2 Area: {rect2.area()}")          # Output: Rectangle 2 Area: 49
print(f"Is Rectangle 2 a square? {rect2.is_square()}") # Output: Is Rectangle 2 a square? True
```

**Explanation:**
*   The `Rectangle` class stores `width` and `height`.
*   It has methods to calculate `area` and `perimeter`.
*   The `is_square` method demonstrates using the object's attributes to provide more information about it.

In essence, classes help organize code, make it reusable, and model real-world (or abstract) entities in your programs.
