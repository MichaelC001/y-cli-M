In Python, a **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and the cookies you make with it are the objects. The cookie cutter defines the shape and general characteristics (e.g., "gingerbread man shape"), and each cookie (object) is an individual instance with its own specific details (e.g., this particular gingerbread man has blue icing buttons, another has red).

Classes encapsulate data (called **attributes** or properties) and functions (called **methods**) that operate on that data.

Here's a simple example:

```python
# Define a class named 'Dog'
class Dog:
    # This is the constructor method, called when you create a new Dog object
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        # These are attributes (data) specific to each Dog object
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.tricks = [] # Initialize an empty list for tricks

    # This is a method (function) that Dog objects can perform
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    # Another method
    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
        return f"{self.name} learned a new trick: {trick}"

# Now, let's create some Dog objects (instances of the Dog class)
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")

# Accessing attributes of the objects
print(f"{dog1.name} is a {dog1.breed}.") # Output: Buddy is a Golden Retriever.
print(f"{dog2.name} is a {dog2.breed}.") # Output: Lucy is a Poodle.

# Calling methods on the objects
print(dog1.bark()) # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(dog2.bark()) # Output: Lucy says Woof!

print(dog1.add_trick("roll over")) # Output: Buddy learned a new trick: roll over
print(dog2.add_trick("fetch"))     # Output: Lucy learned a new trick: fetch

print(f"{dog1.name}'s tricks: {dog1.tricks}") # Output: Buddy's tricks: ['roll over']
print(f"{dog2.name}'s tricks: {dog2.tricks}") # Output: Lucy's tricks: ['fetch']
```

In this example:
*   `Dog` is the class.
*   `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It initializes a new instance of the `Dog` class. `self` refers to the instance being created.
*   `name`, `breed`, and `tricks` are attributes of the `Dog` class. Each `Dog` object will have its own `name`, `breed`, and list of `tricks`.
*   `bark` and `add_trick` are methods that any `Dog` object can perform.
*   `dog1` and `dog2` are objects (or instances) of the `Dog` class.
