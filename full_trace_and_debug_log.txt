2025-05-17 21:28:44.410 | DEBUG    | cli.display_manager:stream_response:270 - Final display string for Markdown rendering:
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

Think of a class as a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter itself isn't a cookie, but you can use it to make many cookies. Each cookie (object) will have the same shape (defined by the class) but can have different features (like different colored frosting, which would be an attribute).

Here's a simple example:

```python
class Dog:
    # This is a special method called the constructor.
    # It's called when you create a new object (a new Dog).
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name  # Attribute: name of the dog
        self.breed = breed # Attribute: breed of the dog
        self.tricks = []   # Attribute: a list to store tricks the dog knows

    # This is a method (a function inside a class)
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    # Another method
    def add_trick(self, trick_name):
        self.tricks.append(trick_name)
        return f"{self.name} learned a new trick: {trick_name}"

# Now, let's create some Dog objects (instances of the Dog class)
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
your_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")

# Accessing attributes
print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name} and it's a {my_dog.breed}.")
print(f"Your dog's name is {your_dog.name} and it's a {your_dog.breed}.")

# Calling methods
print(my_dog.bark())
print(your_dog.bark())

print(my_dog.add_trick("sit"))
print(my_dog.add_trick("roll over"))
print(f"{my_dog.name} knows these tricks: {my_dog.tricks}")

print(your_dog.add_trick("fetch"))
print(f"{your_dog.name} knows these tricks: {your_dog.tricks}")
```

**Explanation of the example:**

1.  **`class Dog:`**: This line defines a new class named `Dog`.
2.  **`__init__(self, name, breed)`**: This is the constructor method.
    *   `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class (the specific dog being created). It's always the first parameter in instance methods.
    *   `name` and `breed` are parameters that you pass when creating a `Dog` object.
    *   Inside `__init__`, `self.name = name` and `self.breed = breed` create and initialize instance attributes. `self.tricks = []` initializes an empty list for each dog.
3.  **`bark(self)`**: This is an instance method. It can access the instance's attributes (like `self.name`).
4.  **`add_trick(self, trick_name)`**: Another instance method that modifies the `self.tricks` attribute.
5.  **Creating Objects (Instances)**:
    *   `my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")` creates an instance of the `Dog` class. The `__init__` method is called automatically. `my_dog` now refers to this specific `Dog` object.
    *   `your_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")` creates another distinct `Dog` object.
6.  **Accessing Attributes**: You use dot notation (e.g., `my_dog.name`) to get the value of an object's attribute.
7.  **Calling Methods**: You also use dot notation (e.g., `my_dog.bark()`) to call an object's method.

In essence, classes help you organize your code by grouping related data and behavior into reusable and logical units.
