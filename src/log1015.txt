In Python, a **class** is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object is a specific instance of a class, and it can have its own attributes (data or variables) and methods (functions that belong to the object).

Think of a class as a general concept or category, and an object as a specific item belonging to that category. For example, `Car` could be a class. This `Car` class would define general properties all cars have (like `color`, `brand`, `model`) and actions all cars can perform (like `start_engine()`, `accelerate()`, `brake()`). Then, a specific car, like "my red Toyota Camry," would be an **object** (or instance) of the `Car` class, with its specific attribute values (color = "red", brand = "Toyota", model = "Camry").

Classes help in:
1.  **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit.
2.  **Reusability:** Defining a class once and then creating multiple objects from it.
3.  **Organization:** Structuring code in a more modular and understandable way, especially for larger programs.

Here are two examples:

**Example 1: Dog Class**

This class defines what a "Dog" is and what it can do.

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances of Dog)
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    # Initializer / Instance attributes
    def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
        self.name = name    # Attribute for the dog's name
        self.breed = breed  # Attribute for the dog's breed
        self.age = age      # Attribute for the dog's age

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says: Woof!"

    # Another instance method
    def describe(self):
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}."

# Creating objects (instances) of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle", 5)

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(dog1.name)         # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.breed)        # Output: Poodle
print(dog1.bark())       # Output: Buddy says: Woof!
print(dog2.describe())   # Output: Lucy is a 5-year-old Poodle.
print(f"All dogs are of the species: {Dog.species}") # Accessing class attribute
```

**Explanation:**
*   `class Dog:` defines a new class named `Dog`.
*   `species = "Canis familiaris"` is a class attribute, shared by all `Dog` objects.
*   `__init__` is a special method called an initializer (or constructor). It's automatically called when you create a new `Dog` object. `self` refers to the instance being created. `name`, `breed`, and `age` are instance attributes, specific to each dog.
*   `bark(self)` and `describe(self)` are instance methods. They can access and modify the instance's attributes using `self`.
*   `dog1 = Dog(...)` and `dog2 = Dog(...)` create two different `Dog` objects.

**Example 2: Rectangle Class**

This class defines a geometric rectangle.

```python
class Rectangle:
    # Initializer / Instance attributes
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        if width <= 0 or height <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Width and height must be positive values.")
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    # Instance method to calculate area
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    # Instance method to calculate perimeter
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

    # Instance method to check if it's a square
    def is_square(self):
        return self.width == self.height

# Creating objects (instances) of the Rectangle class
rect1 = Rectangle(10, 5)
rect2 = Rectangle(7, 7) # This will be a square

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(f"Rectangle 1: Width={rect1.width}, Height={rect1.height}")
print(f"Rectangle 1 Area: {rect1.area()}")          # Output: Rectangle 1 Area: 50
print(f"Rectangle 1 Perimeter: {rect1.perimeter()}")  # Output: Rectangle 1 Perimeter: 30
print(f"Is Rectangle 1 a square? {rect1.is_square()}") # Output: Is Rectangle 1 a square? False

print(f"\nRectangle 2: Width={rect2.width}, Height={rect2.height}")
print(f"Rectangle 2 Area: {rect2.area()}")          # Output: Rectangle 2 Area: 49
print(f"Rectangle 2 Perimeter: {rect2.perimeter()}")  # Output: Rectangle 2 Perimeter: 28
print(f"Is Rectangle 2 a square? {rect2.is_square()}") # Output: Is Rectangle 2 a square? True

# Example of an invalid rectangle
try:
    rect_invalid = Rectangle(10, -2)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"\nError creating rectangle: {e}") # Error creating rectangle: Width and height must be positive values.
```

**Explanation:**
*   `class Rectangle:` defines the blueprint for rectangles.
*   The `__init__` method initializes a rectangle with a given `width` and `height`. It also includes a basic validation.
*   `area()`, `perimeter()`, and `is_square()` are methods that perform operations related to the rectangle's properties.
*   `rect1` and `rect2` are two distinct `Rectangle` objects, each with its own `width` and `height`.

These examples show how classes allow you to define custom data types that group together data (attributes) and behavior (methods) relevant to those types.
